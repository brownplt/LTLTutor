# LTL Tutor

An intelligent tutoring system for Linear Temporal Logic. This tutor is grounded in the findings of [Little Tricky Logics: Misconceptions in the Understanding of LTL](https://cs.brown.edu/~sk/Publications/Papers/Published/gsnk-little-tricky-logic/paper.pdf). 

You can host this tutor following [steps in the wiki](https://github.com/brownplt/LTLTutor/wiki/Hosting-the-LTL-Tutor).

## TODO

- Need to replace the lightpanel exercise with something markedly different but similar?
