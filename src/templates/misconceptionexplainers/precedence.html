      <h4 class="card-title">Tip: Be mindful of operator precedence</h4>
      <p class="card-text">

        When working with logical formulas, especially in contexts where parentheses are not used to explicitly define 
        the evaluation order, understanding operator precedence and associativity is crucial.
        In the absence of parentheses, operators with higher precedence are evaluated first. 
        
        <ul>
            <li> Unary operators (<code>X</code>, <code>F</code>, <code>G</code>, <code>!</code>)
                 have the highest precedence and will bind tightly to the formula that immediately follows them.
            </li>

            <li>Following these, binary operators (<code>&</code>,<code>|</code>,<code>-></code>,<code><-></code>,<code>U</code>)
                come into play, and are left associative. This means that in expressions involving multiple operators, the operations are grouped from left to right.
                For instance, an expression like <code>a | b & c -> d</code> would be interpreted as <code>((a | b) & c) -> d</code>.
            </li>
        </ul>
