      In LTL, the formula <code>X p</code> asserts that <code>p</code> will be true in the next
      state. The next (<code>X</code>) operator is very precise: it only refers to the immediately next state, not
      multiple states ahead or the current state. For instance, the formula <code>X (X p)</code> means <i>p holds two states from now</i>, and
      doesn't imply anything about p holding in the current state, the next state, or three states from now.
      <br>
      Another way to think of this is that the next operator does not fan out its effect;
      it's not about a condition holding over a range of states or eventually. It applies strictly to the very next
      state.
