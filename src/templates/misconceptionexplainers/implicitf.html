      <p class="card-text">

        In LTL, the formula <code>F p</code> asserts that <code>p</code> will eventually be true.
        This means that <code>p</code> can be true in the current state, but it doesn't have to be. What's required is that 
        <code>p</code> becomes true at least once in any future state, including potentially the present state.
        Importantly, <code> F p</code> doesn't specify when <code>p</code> will become true, only that it will 
        definitely become true.

        Thus this trace satisfies the formula <code>F p</code>:


        <pre class="mermaid"> 
            flowchart LR;
            n1["!p"]-->n2["p"];
            n2["p"]-->n2["p"];  
        </pre>

        <br>
        and so does this trace:

        <pre class="mermaid"> 
            flowchart LR;
            n1["!p"]-->n2["!p"];
            n2["!p"]-->n3["!p"];
            n3["!p"]-->n4["p"];
            n4["p"]-->n3["!p"];
        </pre>

      </p>
