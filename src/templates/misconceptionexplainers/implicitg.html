        In LTL, the formula <code>G x</code> means that the proposition <code>x</code> is
        always true from the current state onwards, not just in the current state. 
        On the other hand, simply stating the proposition <code>x</code> only
        requires that <code>x</code> be true in the current state.
        <br><br>
        For example, if <code>x</code> represents <i>'the system is secure'</i>, 
        then <code>G x</code> would mean that the system must be secure at all times, in every possible future state.
        On the other hand, <code>x</code> would mean that the system is secure in the current state, but it may not be secure in the future.
