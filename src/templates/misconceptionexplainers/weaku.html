        In LTL, <code>x U y</code> means that <code>x</code> holds at every step until 
       <code>y</code> becomes true. Importantly, <code>x U y</code> guarantees that there
       is a time in the future when <code>y</code> becomes true. 
       Similarly, <code>x U y</code> guarantees that <code>x</code> holds at the current state.
